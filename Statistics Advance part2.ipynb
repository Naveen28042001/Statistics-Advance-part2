    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics, but it comes with certain assumptions that need to be met for its application. \n",
    "These assumptions ensure that the conditions are favorable for the sample means to follow a normal distribution as the sample size increases. \n",
    "Here are the key assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Sampling:\n",
    "  The data must be collected through a random sampling process. Each observation in the sample should be independent of the others, meaning that the selection of one observation does not influence the selection of another.\n",
    "Independence:\n",
    "  The observations in the sample must be independent of each other. This means that the occurrence of one observation does not affect the occurrence of another. For example, in the context of time-series data, observations at different time points should be independent.\n",
    "Sample Size:\n",
    "  The sample size (n) should be sufficiently large. There is no strict rule for what constitutes a \"sufficiently large\" sample size, but a common guideline is that n should be at least 30. In some cases, even smaller sample sizes can yield approximately normal distributions, especially if the underlying population distribution is not strongly skewed.\n",
    "Finite Variance:\n",
    "  The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite variance (σ^2). The variance is a measure of the spread of the data. If the variance is infinite, the sample mean may not converge to a normal distribution.\n",
    "Identically Distributed:\n",
    "  The random variables in the population should be identically distributed. While they don't have to follow a normal distribution, the shape of their distribution should be the same for each random variable.\n",
    "Finite Mean:\n",
    "  The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite mean (μ). If the mean is infinite, the sample mean may not converge to a normal distribution.\n",
    "It's important to note that while the CLT is powerful and widely applicable, it doesn't guarantee normality for any sample size. \n",
    "However, as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean becomes increasingly normal, allowing for the reliable use of statistical methods that assume normality. \n",
